<br />

Norse is a free and open-source search engine.

- **Data-agnostic schema**. Behind the scenes we are taking advantage of an open-source data standard created by [Open Referral](https://openreferral.org/) called [HSDS](https://docs.openreferral.org/en/v2.0.1/hsds/) (Human Services Data Specification).
- **It's FAST** :rocket:. No more long waiting times when searching for community resources. We take advantage of modern architecture and caching systems to make search take milliseconds instead of seconds!
- **Internationalized**. We've built Norse from the ground up to be integrated with i18n. The non-dynamic data on the client is being translated in to several languages, and our data schema fully supports translations for all of your data.
